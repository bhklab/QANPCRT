name: QUANNOTATE for Quality Assessment of Radiological Images
description: Multi-institutional trials involving modern radiotherapy (RT) techniques
  are unique in that treatment quality can be assessed by reviewing digitized medical
  images and associated RT structures. Nonetheless, quality assurance (QA) of large-scale
  trials is always challenging because of time-consuming processes for collecting
  and reviewing hundreds or thousands of individual cases. We developed QUANNOTATE,
  a web-application that allows rapid review of large numbers of RT target volumes
  in an easily accessible format without requiring access to the RT planning system
  (https://www.quannotate.com). We used QUANNOTATE to evaluate the relationship between
  target delineation compliance with the international guidelines and treatment outcomes
  in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients undergoing definitive RT. Despite highly
  guideline-compliant coverage of critical structures, undercoverage of cavernous
  sinus was correlated with increased local failure. Data standardization is a key
  issue in medical image-based radiomics studies, and our data suggest that radiomics
  analysis should be preceded by detailed QA analysis to ensure outcomes are not confounded
  due to variance in treatment related factors as opposed to tumor factors.
